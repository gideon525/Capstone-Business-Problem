BUSINESS PROBLEM: INTRODUCTION
John and Mary, an immigrant couple from the West African country of Nigeria arrived in the United State last April and are settled in the city of Houston, Texas.
Whenever they travel around the city in buses and trains, they notice other passengers of color who were likely of African origin. 
Also, at public places, such as parks, clubs and churches, John and Mary encountered people of African descent. 
Their observation of such high number of peoples from their common African culture got them thinking that they could use this peculiar human resource to further their 
economic interest and start a business in Houston similar to the one they had back home while living in Lagos, Nigeria: An African Restaurant.
Among the many challenges John and Mary expect to face while setting up their business is the decision to select a location to site their proposed restaurant location.
To help resolve this problem they have contacted their friend, Peter, who is a data scientist to help the use location data to find the main areas of Houston Texas where 
people from African origin live and work. 
These people will represent the bulk of their customers and patrons for their proposed restaurant Peter will attempt to use foursquare location data to identify 
the demographics of the Houston area and to find the appropriate location of the proposed John and Mary restaurant to serve the people of African origins in the Houston area of
Texas, United States of America
